# tic-tac-toe-in-python


To run the Tic Tac Toe code in a GitHub repository, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can run the code by using the following command in a terminal window:

tic_tac_toe.py

# This will execute the Python code in the file tic_tac_toe.py. Make sure to replace tic_tac_toe.py with the name of your file if it is different.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to run the code in a Python interpreter:

python

# This will open the Python interpreter, where you can enter the code manually and execute it line by line.
